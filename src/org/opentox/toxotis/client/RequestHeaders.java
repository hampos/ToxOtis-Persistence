/**
 * This is a collection of some HTTP Request and Entity Headers gathered from the
 * W3C specifications at http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html.
 * <p align=justify><em>Documentation copied here from the W3C specification for HTTP Headers : </em>
 * HTTP header fields, which include general-header (section 4.5), request-header
 * (section 5.3), response-header (section 6.2), and entity-header (section 7.1) fields,
 * follow the same generic format as that given in Section 3.1 of RFC 822 [9].
 * Each header field consists of a name followed by a colon (":") and the field value.
 * Field names are case-insensitive. The field value MAY be preceded by any amount of
 * LWS, though a single SP is preferred. Header fields can be extended over multiple
 * lines by preceding each extra line with at least one SP or HT. Applications ought to
 * follow "common form", where one is known or indicated, when generating HTTP constructs,
 * since there might exist some implementations that fail to accept anything beyond the common
 * forms.
 * </p>
 * <pre> message-header = field-name ":" [ field-value ]
 *      field-name     = token
 *      field-value    = *( field-content | LWS )
 *      field-content  = <the OCTETs making up the field-value
 *                       and consisting of either *TEXT or combinations
 *                       of token, separators, and quoted-string>
